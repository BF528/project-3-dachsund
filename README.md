# Project Title
Concordance of Microarray and RNA-Seq Differential Gene

# Project Description
In this project, we perform quality control, process, differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq data with DESeq2 and pre-normalized microarray expression data using limma, and mapped them between Affymetrix and refSeq identifier systems to better understand the concordance of microarray and RNA-Seq.

This repository contains the batch script files and R scripts of sequencing analysis.
